An extension of mediafragment.js (by Thomas Steiner, Google)

Media Fragments URI is a W3C specification with the objective to provide for
media-format independent, standard means of addressing media fragments on the
Web using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).
(http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Fragments/)

Many video sharing platforms have already implemented their own means of media fragments, such as the following URIs

They are not strictly following the Media Fragment URI specification. 
But it is also useful to extend the original parser to be able to extract media fragment information from those URIs.

features:
1. uri should use protocol http or https
2. use better uri parsing regex
3. consider the media fragments implemented by video sharing platforms, such as youtube
4. seconds could be bigger than 60 as long as minutes and hours are empty
